### Marmeto Task Round 2 - Product Selection UI Development

#### Objective:
To develop a product selection UI component for an e-commerce platform. This component allows users to browse various categories (Men, Women, Kids) and view products with details such as price, discount, and brand.

#### Features:
- **Category Selection Tabs**: Separate product categories for Men, Women, and Kids.
- **Product Cards**: Display product image, brand name, description, original price, discounted price, and discount percentage.
- **Special Labels**: Labels for offers such as "Wedding Special", "New Season", or "On Offer" for promotional or seasonal items.
- **Add to Cart**: A button below each product to enable quick cart addition functionality.
  
#### Technologies to Use:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript/React.js
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for responsive layouts and product card designs.
- **Backend/Integration**: API fetch or dummy JSON data for products, brands, and offers.

#### Key Components:
1. **Product Category Tabs**:
   - Navigation options for Men, Women, and Kids.
   - Upon clicking a category, only products from the selected category should display.

2. **Product Cards**:
   - Product images and details displayed in card format.
   - Each card contains a product image, name, price, discount, and a label like "Wedding Special" or "New Season".
   - Buttons to allow users to "Add to Cart".

3. **Discount Calculation**:
   - Display the original and discounted price.
   - Calculate and display the percentage of discount dynamically.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure the UI is responsive for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

#### Deliverables:

#### Future Enhancements:
